# M5Stick-Captive-Portal
Here is the complete Arduino sketch to initiate the Wi-Fi honeypot in the M5Stick C, it will create a free access point and once the user is connected to the access point it will ask for the user credentials. Once we get the credentials it will blink the LED and alert us.  Also, we can view the captured passwords via the same access point. 

a new version of this sketch will be released in the next few days with an improved and more attractive ui design.
For educational and learning purposes ONLY, not to be used for credential hacking or theft.
